I can't believe I am experiencing a historical event, or even become a part of one. Sadly that historical event is a ***global pandemic***.
# 6th July 2022
I felt fine, also went outside my house for a few errands before work starts. My mother was experiencing mild flu symptomps though.
# 7th July 2022
I had a fever, headache, sore throat, all flu symptomps. I consulted a doctor online through a telemedicine app to request a sick letter and medicine. She gave me what I wanted, and also told me to go try to do a swab test, which I can only do by Saturday (9th July 2022). At around 16:30 my fever flared up to 38.2 degrees Celcius, and my muscles are all sore. I had a hard time trying to fall asleep, and also can't sleep for long periods. This was the peak of my symptoms.
# 8th July 2022
I still had my symptoms, but it was not as bad as yesterday. I was taking a personal leave because I wanted to met a specialist doctor, but I didn't go because I wasn't fit enough. My father started having symptoms as well, so we all agreed to do a swab test by tomorrow.
# 9th July 2022
Moment of truth: we all tested positive, that means no going outside until the 19th of July. This sucks a lot because:
- I'm sick
- My mom is now naggier than normal, which causes me more headache
- My dad now works from home (previously work from office)
- Since both mom and dad are home, they both clash a lot
- I am the only one that is tech savvy, so I needed to do a lot of ordering food / telemedicine to get free meds from the country

My sense of smell is now gone, and I realized this when my sleep spray has no scent.
# 13th July 2022
My sense of smell has returned, and I stopped coughing a lot. I still have a lot of clear nasal discharge though.
# 18th July 2022
Did another rapid antigen test again and it is negative, which is great.
