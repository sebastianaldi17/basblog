Hi everyone, how have you been? 2022 has been a pretty eventful year, but I forgot most if not all of the events happening globally. The only impactful things that happened in my life happened in the form of my coworkers resigning one by one. I'm serious, if you check my Instagram, most of my posts has been saying farewell to my colleagues:

- In late April, a senior coworker in the same squad as me [resigned](https://www.instagram.com/p/CcXJJN8rK-U/). Things were tough but they could be worse (and it did end up worse later on).
- In early June, my lead [resigned](https://www.instagram.com/p/CeOK0V3hE3Z/), leaving the squad having no lead-level software engineer. The brunt of the meetings went to a senior software engineer that wanted to avoid managerial roles but was forced to step in since he is the longest in the squad.
- In late June, a coworker in a different squad but the same tribe [resigned](https://www.instagram.com/p/CfJsAxGhyC0/). He was the one who kept proposing games to play during a dedicated event, to keep morale high and maintain work relationships.
- In late August, my mentor [resigned](https://www.instagram.com/p/ChwlebKhgKa/). He was the one that is forced to step in as lead, and if I were forced to be in meetings all the time and still have to work as an individual contributor, I might go ballistic. Now the oldest individual contributor to the squad entered 1 month earlier than me, so both of us were kind of shouldering the responsibility of being the most senior.
- In mid-November, GoTo announced a 12% [layoff](https://jakartaglobe.id/tech/goto-to-lay-off-12-of-employees-in-efficiency-program). There were rumors, but the announcement was very sudden. Thankfully none of the individual contributors in my squad were impacted, but there was a handful of impacted people that I knew. I hope they could find a new job.
- A few days after the layoff, a coworker in a different squad but the same tribe [resigned](https://www.instagram.com/p/ClkcZVzBaNf/). He got accepted as a software engineer in Japan and had to relocate (was not remote). This is sad because I got to know him and we both enjoy playing arcade rhythm games, and now my fellow arcade rhythm gamer is in a different country. Good luck living in Japan, that sounds really nice.

Long story short, I "lost" quite a lot of connections. Some of my university friends were also no longer reachable physically (catching up with them online is still possible).

But I don't want this post to be all sad and melancholic. The purpose of this post is to highlight past events and make a final bucket list that I intend on completing before this year ends.

# Past events
After doing some research online and on my memory, here are some notable past events of 2022, in no particular order:

- Russia invades Ukraine, and I think as of writing, this is still ongoing. Tensions are high, and there were talks of world war 3 happening.
- If you are an Indonesian, there is a new policy that states you need to be at least 56 years old in order to claim JHT (a pension fund). This caused some labor strikes to happen, and I honestly wonder if the restriction still applies.
- You can choose to not wear face masks **outdoors** in Indonesia. In enclosed spaces masks are still mandatory.
- Protests in Sri Lanka. The previous president ended up resigning.
- Kominfo (Ministry of Communication and Information) blocks multiple foreign services, including PayPal and Steam. Many were mad, and eventually, the policies were reverted.
- I have no idea why Brigadier J's death caused a huge uproar. If anyone more knowledgeable than me is interested in explaining that would be great.
- Liz Truss is appointed as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but that didn't end well. She resigned 50 days later due to bad policies (reducing energy spending, cutting tax for the rich), and was succeeded by Rishi Sunak.
- Hacking incidents on Indonesian government-maintained services are happening. Bjorka claimed to be responsible for these hacks.
- 135 people died on Stadion Kanjuruhan, Indonesia. The cause of death was because police used tear gas on the rioting fans (their team lost the game).
- Queen Elizabeth II dies, rest in peace. No more immortal queen memes.
- Elon Musk acquires Twitter, fires the board members, fires many employees, and sells the funny blue checkmark as a subscription model. You can't make this up.
- 158 people died in Seoul due to crowd crush during Halloween.
- G20 is held in Bali. Westoids mald seeing world leaders wear Batik.
- A lot of layoffs, including from Meta, Amazon, Twitter, GoTo, Shopee, Sirclo, and many more.
- FIFA World Cup is ongoing, but I don't really care about soccer.
- Protests against China's Zero-COVID policies are still happening, I hope my friend who went there is safe.
- Analogue TV no longer works in Indonesia. We digital now.
- Quite a significant number of earthquakes happening lately.

# Bucket list
Have you ever heard of Tim Urban's TED talk about procrastination? You can watch/listen to it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU). The short version is that most procrastinators get stuff done because **hard** deadlines exist. After we graduate from school, there are no more hard deadlines, you just work-rest-work-rest until the deadline that is your death. This post is an attempt to set things I want to do, and the deadline is before this year ends. Here are the things in my bucket list, in order of effort needed.

## Take a day off
![garf](https://media.tenor.com/a60F0R-Xap4AAAAC/smash-the-alarm-clock-garfield.gif#center)
Yes, take a day off. Even on weekends I run errands for my family, try to learn new skills, or gaslight myself into keep trying to improve at things. I feel like I haven't had a decent rest at all. Even when sleeping I kept thinking about solutions to problems at work. Feels like my eyes are dry and my brain is overloaded. I want to take a single day off, just wake up, eat, take a bath, and sleep. No social media, no exertion, just resting physically and mentally.

## Refactor my wardrobe
![wardrobe](https://media.tenor.com/gaG1HrsVrxoAAAAC/k3-studio100.gif#center)
My wardrobe has too many clothes that I don't want to use because they're too hot. It is hard to find shirts I want to wear if there are a lot of unwanted clothes. I plan on "refactoring" the contents of my wardrobe so that I can just pick any shirt from my wardrobe.

While I'm on this topic, I also have too many shirts, but very few socks and underwear. There are days where I can't find clean underwear because most of them are being washed. Socks are even rarer than underwear and is the main reason why I don't walk around my neighborhood much. I probably only have 2 pairs of socks. I used to have many of them, but they're lost to "time".

## Learn about authentication
![auth](https://media.tenor.com/d8vJV1CfSTcAAAAd/loging-into-your-computer.gif#center)
I am a backend engineer that does not know about authentication using JWT. That doesn't mean I don't want to learn about it though. I didn't need knowledge about authentication because I didn't have to deal with security and authentication. But in software engineering, ignorance is not bliss. This is why I probably will make a simple node.js + react.js app to test out how authentication works. Probably might learn a bit about MongoDB as well on the process.

## Brush up on PostgreSQL
![postgresql](https://media.tenor.com/yfRbDajBsC8AAAAC/spongebob-database.gif#center)
What are indexes? What is a foreign key? What is a subquery? What are joins? What's a view? What is a trigger?

My PostgreSQL is very limited because I only picked up on what I needed. Which are simple queries, and an occasional index for a performance boost. It pains me to admit that my PostgreSQL knowledge is very lacking, and that causes me to be not flexible because I don't know the full extent/capabilities of what PostgreSQL can do.

## Investigate on demand skills
![research](https://media.tenor.com/yUCyNy4Z2iEAAAAC/research-shows-smart.gif#center)
As of writing, I still have a job. I survived the layoff wave on the 18th of November. That doesn't guarantee that I won't be laid off in the future. The hassle of working as a software engineer is that there are many new tech as time goes on. If I don't keep up, I will be left in the dust. Just because I have a job now doesn't mean I should keep coasting on my current job. No harm in investigating what skills are currently in demand. But I don't think I can investigate and learn at the same time as all the other things in my bucket list. After all, there are only 17 days left this year.

## Reflect
![meditate](https://media.tenor.com/K9j6vDmLBYcAAAAC/hologra-hololive.gif#center)
If you saw my [first post](/posts/my-first-post/), then you probably knew what my long-term goals are.

> Pursue a masters degree, so that I can be a lecturer when I retire from being a software engineer.

> Pursue game development, 2D/3D design, music and content creation.

> Learn Japanese.

But ever since I got a job as a software engineer, I found myself stagnating hard, because it took a lot of effort to fit in (in terms of skill, not socially). I felt burned out due to the extra effort over an extended period. After my first year, I finally got used to the tech stack used, the coding style, and the methodology of the squad. But one by one, my seniors left, and the work got evenly divided among the remaining team members. My daily life is the same:

1. Wake up
2. Do morning chores
3. Work
4. Lunch
5. Work
6. Rest up, play with friends
7. Sleep

On the weekends I would have more time that can be used for extra rest or learning new skills, going to the arcade to play, etc.

### Pursue a masters degree
![degree](https://media.tenor.com/BTHc82DNltcAAAAC/steven-he-masters.gif#center)
I did say I wanted to be a lecturer. But I got a job as a private tutor, and I kind of realized that I enjoy teaching people who enjoy being taught. The happiness of the student being taught is also my happiness. But as a teacher, you don't get to give preferential treatment to certain students (you can, but you will get called out for this attitude).

Also, I am very burned out and traumatized by my own thesis when I was an undergraduate. That anguish still remained in my heart and is the main reason why I don't feel like returning to academia.

Besides, isn't an undergraduate degree enough for a software engineer? What needs to be impressive is your portfolio, not your title or what university you graduated from. I kept telling myself this as I wonder about life in the future when I no longer can code for long sessions.

I think a masters degree is a good insurance because it might be required in the future. But I would like to find a scholarship if possible, to lessen the financial burden.

### Pursue GameDev / Content Creation
![danidev](https://media.tenor.com/_axZydJHyAAAAAAC/dani-whats-up-gamers.gif#center)
This seemed easier in my head. Turns out it is not. The path ahead is pretty rocky, involving:
1. Learning the fundamentals of Unity and what it can do
2. Finding an idea for a game I want to make
3. Finding/making assets (sprites/3D models, music, sound effects)
4. Actually making the game
5. Monetize (ads? pay once?)

Every step is a time-consuming process. I'm trying to learn Unity while doing my day job. Even if I just do a "create a project first, learn later" approach, I don't have any idea for a game I want to make. Finding/making assets is also hard, because finding one that fits with your game is hard, and making it yourself is harder because it involves learning how to make music, draw, or model. So for now, I'm stuck in 1-2, and thinking about 3 makes me feel tired already. The main reason why I wanted to make games is to pursue a passive income, but I'm not sure if all of this is worth it.

### Learn Japanese
![peko](https://media.tenor.com/c64HzV4AewsAAAAd/pekora-pardun.gif#center)
I am learning Japanese, but it is an uphill battle. It's gotten to the point where I question why I even bother.

- Similar-looking letters.
  - さ and ち. Also, さ has two versions:
  ![sa](https://i.redd.it/zsldf497d9f31.png#center)
  - ぬ and め.
  - ろ and る.
  - ね, わ, and れ.
  - コ and ユ.
  - ツ, シ, ン, and ソ.
- Kanji can have many ways to pronounce it. The correct way depends on what hiragana/kanji is also paired with it.
  - [来](https://jisho.org/search/%E6%9D%A5%20%23kanji) can be pronounced kuru, kitaru, kitasu, kitaru, ki, ko, rai.
  - [体](https://jisho.org/search/%E4%BD%93%20%23kanji) can be pronounced karada, katachi, tai, tei.
  - [上](https://jisho.org/search/%E4%B8%8A%20%23kanji) can be pronounced ue, uwa, kami, ageru, agaru, agari, noboru, nobori, noboseru, nobosu, tatematsuru, jou, shou, shan.
  - Expect most/all kanji to have more than one way to pronounce it.
- Same pronunciation, different meaning.
  - した can mean below (下) or tongue (舌).
  - かみ can mean paper (紙), deity (神), hair (髪), seasoning (加味) or above (上).
- A lot of vocabulary has similar meanings.
  - 売る means to sell, 売れる means to sell well.
  - 食品 means food product, 食べ物 means food, 食事 means meal.
  - 開く means to open doors, 開ける means to open doors or to unwrap (but transitive, so requires a subject), 開く means to undo, to open, to unseal. Yes, you saw that right. 開く can be pronounced ひらく or あく, and they have different meanings.
- Numbering and counters in Japanese are kind of weird.
  - 1 minute is いっぷん, 2 minutes is にふん, 3 minutes is さんぷん, and so on.
  - Dates from 1 - 10 is weird (tsuitachi, futsuka, mikka, ...), then 11 becomes normal (juu ichi nichi). 20 is weird though (hatsuka).
  - Sometimes 4 is used as shi (shigatsu = april), sometimes used as yon (yondai = 4 vehicles), sometimes use as yo (4 o clock).
- JLPT levels don't progress in a linear way. They go up exponentially. See the picture below. To be fair, some people claim that JLPT N3 is the essential needed to live in Japan.
![JLPT](https://gogonihon.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/JLPT-levels-English-724x1024.png#center)

I'm still learning, even if it feels meaningless. At least I can claim to people that I understand some Japanese. In fact, I plan on refactoring the cheat sheet I made in Google Sheets. Once I'm done refactoring it, I will share the previous version (not the refactored one :simple_smile:). The things I need to do are:

- Remove -masu words and other conjugated form words from my vocabulary bank. They're just dictionary form but conjugated to be formal. For example, 食べます the polite version of 食べる, and they both mean "to eat". 食べた is the past tense version, 食べました is the polite past version, and a lot more. My current vocabulary bank has a lot of -masu entries, and I will clean them up.
- Add an example sentence for each word in the vocabulary bank. This part will be hard since I got almost 800 words in there.
- Add parts of speech to each word in the vocabulary bank. When learning English, I skipped over sentence structuring and just said whatever seems right. Now that I'm older, I really appreciate sentence structure, because my mind would blank out trying to form a sentence. By the way, the Japanese language has a lot of parts of speech.
  - Some verbs are transitive, and some are intransitive.
  - Some verbs end with -ru (ichidan verb), while others end with -u (godan verb. Some -ru ending verbs are classified as -u verbs, for example, 分かる is a godan verb (when conjugating 分かる, you don't say 分かます, but you say 分かります).
  - Some verbs called "suru verbs" are nouns that can work as verbs (for example, [勉強](https://jisho.org/search/%E5%8B%89%E5%BC%B7) is a noun that means study, but if you say 勉強する or 勉強します, it means "to study". 勉強をする means the same thing as 勉強する.)
  - Some adjectives end with -i, and some adjectives end with -na. However, some adjectives that end with -i are classified as -na adjectives. For example, [嫌い](https://jisho.org/search/%E5%AB%8C%E3%81%84).
  - Some words have kanji, but is commonly written using kana alone. For example, suru (to do) is 為る, but usually written using hiragana only.
- Separate conjugation into a different sheet. I combined my grammar sheet with my conjugation sheet, and that makes it hard for me to find how to conjugate a noun/verb/adjective.

# Closing statement
I expected this to be a short blog post, but it ended up extra long. 2022 has been a good year, but it also had some bad moments. My main takeaway from this year is that I don't want to stagnate, even if I like my current job. Rather than being guided by the passage of time, I should try to be more proactive. But for now, I just want to rest up until the end of this year, and face 2023 with renewed resolve. Thank you for being with me, and here's to a great 2023.
