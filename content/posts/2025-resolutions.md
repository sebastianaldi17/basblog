# Intro
2024... A lot has happened in this world, but if I were to name the single most impactful event this year, it would be that one event that happened on the 14th of June, 2024.

It was my first time getting laid off, and it really gave me some really high highs and low lows. From the happiness of earning 9 months of salary and a 14 inch macbook pro, anxiety from having no income, feelings of envy for other people that found a job faster than me, dread of job interviews where my fate is decided by other people, and relief after finally finding a new job.

Anyway, time to reflect on my past resolutions!

## Reflection time
I had 4 resolutions, here are the results.

### maimai: Achieve 15500 rating

Done. I actually achieved 15500 way earlier than expected, on 5th of July. 15500 is actually not that hard, since 50 13.8 SSS+ is achievable, and I had buffers from higher level songs with SSS+ score.

### PIU: Get Intermediate Lv.9

Done. Also got this one earlier than expected, on 25th of March. I am now way out of shape though, since I stopped playing PIU regularly.

### Get JLPT N4 certification
So I missed the first JLPT exam since I was outside during the registration period, but I managed to join the second JLPT exam. Thing is, the result is announced 2 months after the exam, so I still don't know if I passed or not. Truthfully I think I might be screwed by the listening section, so I don't have any expectations on this one.

### Learn Spring Boot
I did learn it, and I think I get it. I made a [sample CRUD API](https://github.com/sebastianaldi17/sample-todo-app) using it. I don't have any professional experience though, so this "learning experience" is worthless in the eyes of recruiters.

## New resolutions time
Alright, let's get to the new resolutions.

### maimai: Achieve 15750 rating
Same stuff, but this time the threshold is 50 14.0 SSS+ or higher. A HUGE leap in difficulty, but a year is a really long time. Who knows what will happen.

### PIU: Get Internmediate Lv.10
Not gonna lie, I don't think I can do this one. I managed to cheese through easy level 18 songs, but I don't think there's many easy level 19 songs. But again, a year is a really long time. Fingers crossed.

### JLPT: Retake N4 if needed, take N3 on 2nd period
Hopefully I don't have to retake N4, but if I don't pass the December 2024 exam, then I will retake it on July 2025. For December 2025, I plan on taking N3 no matter what.

### Life: Reduce sugar intake, exercise more
I think one of the side effects of being laid off is that it amplified my hedonism. I just didn't care anymore. I drank and ate a lot of sweet stuff, stopped exercising, and lazed around a lot. I want to fix myself starting from 2025, and hopefully maintain it throughout the new year.

Alright thats it see ya
