# Third website?
Yes, this is my third time making a personal website. The first time was using plain `HTML`, `Bootstrap`, and `Javascript`, then publishing it to Github pages. The second time was using `React.js` with `Material-UI`, which can be seen [here](https://github.com/sebastianaldi17/React-Personal-Site). It used `netlify` to host static pages, and it worked pretty well until I decided to take down the website for several reasons:

- I got a job as a software engineer, so I felt that I didn't need to advertise myself that much.
- I wanted to make a blog, but at the time I didn't know how because I wanted to keep a folder full of markdown files that serve as blog content, but I can't get it to work without a backend iterating through the folder containing multiple markdown files.

After a coworker decided to leave their current job, I decided that I wanted to start exploring my options. The solution I decided to use was to use [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to create static `HTML` files from `markdown` files. I used `hugo` because `hugo` used `Go`, which was already installed on my laptop (compared to using `jekyll` needing `Ruby` installed, but in retrospect this might have been way easier because Github pages endorsed it).

`Hugo` did not want to play nice with Github pages at all. I tried to use the `github-actions` method (building static files on a separate branch and have Github pages show that), but every post returns a 404 not found (from Github pages, not from `hugo` itself). On the other hand, `netlify` pretty much ran well without many problems, which is why I went with it.

# Who am I?
I'm a Software Engineer (Backend) that graduated from Pelita Harapan University at the year 2021, and currently working for Tokopedia. Some of my hobbies are:
- Rhythm gaming (arcade and non arcade, for example maimai, sound voltex, osu!)
- Mechanical keyboards
- Audio gear

# Current situation
At this time of writing, I just finished getting an endoscopy because I tend to vomit after eating or drinking anything. My digestive problem began at 2018, when I kept missing my dinner because of being a university student, private tutor, and event comitee at the same time. The doctor diagnosed me with [esophagitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagitis), and there is a polyp on my esophagus which the doctor refused to remove because of said esophagitis. Health is expensive, so having a lot of money would make me more peaceful inside. Money can't buy you happiness, but it sure can relieve some adult issues.

# Going forward
I need to focus on recovering first, so that I can move on with my life. Once that is done, I would probably pursue content creation as a hobby while keeping my day job as a software engineer. For this website, I would probably have separate tags for the posts I make here, such as life updates, audio/keyboard review, etc. Maybe one day I might pursue game development for passive income (it *was* also my passion) and end up creating an itch.io account and a youtube channel. If it does end up that way, I will update my links in this website. My long term goals are probably these:

- Pursue a masters degree, so that I can be a lecturer when I retire from being a software engineer.
- Pursue game development, 2D/3D design, music and content creation
- Learn Japanese

I think that is all. I hope this is the final "personal website" that I make, but no promises~
