# Long time no see?
The last post I made was on the 13th of January, after my septoplasty surgery. Since then, a lot of things happened, but I just didn't have the time, energy, and motivation to write up a new post. But now, after you-know-what, I am now here writing a new post.

# What happened?
Ok, so let's recap what happened while I was away:

- ByteDance (TikTok's parent company) [acquired Tokopedia](https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/11/tiktok-to-invest-1-5b-in-gotos-indonesia-e-commerce-business/). Coincidentally, Tokopedia was my workplace. This move got us using Lark suite, migrating our codebase to their GitLab, and moving our services to their datacenter.
- My third work anniversary happened on the 29th of March. I recieved a (might be refurbished, the charging cable was unnaturally dirty) Sennheiser Accentum. I also get to claim "3 year working experience", which might do me more damage than good. Entry level jobs wouldn't want me, and I'm too inexperienced to be considered a senior software engineer.
- [ByteDance laid off 450 employees](https://jakartaglobe.id/business/bytedance-to-lay-off-450-employees-in-indonesia-after-merger-with-tokopedia), across all teams. On the 13th of June, we were told to work from home, and there will be a briefing tomorrow, at 9 AM. I wish I was there when the email was sent, to see the final reaction of my coworkers. ***Unfortunately*** (or fortunately?), I was part of the 450 employees that were laid off.

# So, what now?
As of writing this page, I'm still unemployed. Not from lack of trying though. Below is a sankey graph, the text version, and an explanation:
![](/Images/TheEndAndANewBeginning/sankey.png)
```
Applications [6] Coding test
Applications [7] HR interview
Applications [5] Rejected
Applications [19] No answer

Coding test [3] HR interview
Coding test [2] Rejected
Coding test [1] No answer

HR interview [3] Logic interview
HR interview [1] Rejected
HR interview [2] No answer

Logic interview [1] System interview
Logic interview [2] Rejected

System interview [1] Culture interview
System interview [1] No answer

Culture interview [1] No answer
```
So what's this? Let me explain:

- 6 applications got into a coding test (hackerrank or other coding platforms)
- 7 applications got me into an interview with their recruiter
- 5 applications were rejected, some time after I submitted my CV
- 19 applications got no answer (as of writing)

- 3 coding tests got me into an interview with their recruiter
- 2 coding tests were rejected
- 1 coding test got no answer (as of writing)

- 3 HR interviews got me into a first user interview with their software engineer, usually talking about logic
- 1 HR interview was rejected
- 2 HR interviews got no answer (as of writing)

- 1 logic interview got me into an interview with another software engineer, this time talking about system design
- 2 logic interviews were rejected

- 1 system design interview got me into an interview with an engineering manager, to talk about culture fit
- 1 system design interview got no answer (as of writing)

- 1 culture interview got no answer (as of writing)

It's probably not that bad, because I've heard stories of other people having more than 100 applications without getting a single offer. Besides, ByteDance gave me a very generous severance package and my parents still have jobs, so I could go jobless for a long time.

For a while, I felt like I need to find a new job as soon as possible, and every single failed application was because of my lack of skills. Now, I acknowledge that there are also external factors at play, such as

- Large supply, small demmand of software engineers
- Lack of investment to the companies that I'm applying to
- Someone more skilled or experienced than me applied to the same position, and they got accepted

I'm slowly fixing my mental, and keep applying for more jobs. Every interview I get is a chance, and every failure is a means of improvement. The more interviews I recieve, the more I know what type of questions are asked, and the more I can prepare for them. Eventually, one application should succeed, because I only need a single job offer.

Thanks for reading, I would appreciate it if any of you can refer me to your workplace :smile:
