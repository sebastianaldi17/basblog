- These are affiliate links, so if you do buy from these (for some reason), thank you.
- These are my opinion, therefore it is subjective.
- I rate these as a whole package. For example, I do care if an earphone/headphone has removable cables or not, I care about the build quality, I care about the sound.
## IEM (In Ear Monitors)
### CCA CRA
![CCA CRA](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/500-square/hDjmkQ/2022/3/6/cfde7e45-1c9e-4f00-8230-bde4cd7dc811.jpg#center)

I want to tell you a story about my experience with Chi-fi (Chinese hi-fi). During my senior high school days, I used to get cheap earphones, but they kept breaking in a few months. Since then, I've gotten a KZ ZS3, and it still works after 3++ years. I would have recommended the KZ ZS3, if not for the CCA CRA's existence. I bought these on May 2022, so I can't speak for the longevity of the product. However, it has the same features as the KZ ZS3 (over the ear hook, removable cable), with (subjectively) better sound. How does it have better sound? By actually having a listenable midrange.
![CRA vs ZS3](/Images/Recommendations/ZS3vsCRA.png#center)
As you can see on the graph above, the ZS3 has a substantial depression on 600 - 4000 Hz. That is where most instruments and vocals are, so why remove that? The CRA is also a v-shaped IEM, but it doesn't sacrifice the midrange to have an enjoyable bass and treble. Not even AutoEQ can fix my enjoyment of the ZS3. The CCA CRA in my opinion is a better v-shaped IEM than the ZS3, period.

### Moondrop Chu
![Chu](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/700/VqbcmM/2022/4/8/680d7a3a-b117-4905-9545-49be9bf7f096.jpg#center)
[Link](https://tokopedia.link/6T4yH1Joarb) | Rp. 320.000 (with mic), Rp. 290.000 (without mic)

These babies are so overhyped that I got them when it was still in pre-order. They come with a full set of spring tips, which are pretty expensive on their own. My impression? Turns out I don't really like neutral tuning that much. I want a slight boost on the bass and mids, so maybe the BLON BL-03 might be good for me.

![Chu vs Spaceship](/Images/Recommendations/ChuvsSpaceship.png#center)
They claim to be the successor to the successor to the Moondrop Spaceship. I tend to believe them. Spaceship's sub-bass is more lacking making it feel airy. It also has a lower midrange than the Chu, making vocals and instruments sound quieter. But again, this is subjective, because the Spaceship is tuned for diffuse field, while the Chu is tuned to be neutral.

The cable is not removable, which could be a dealbreaker for some. The earbuds have a metal build, which is nice. I end up using AutoEQ on them to make them sound better for me (again, subjective). If you want a (pretty) cheap neutral IEM with removable cable, go for the Tripowin Lea. They should sound similar, based on the frequency response below.

By the way, you can modify the Moondrop Chu to make it has removable cables. I haven't tried it myself, but [here is someone who offers their service to modify the Chus](https://tokopedia.link/Iv3AeAOrarb).

## TWS (True Wireless Stereo)
### Haylou GT1 Pro
![GT1 Pro](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/500-square/VqbcmM/2022/1/5/c484a6ce-124f-4e7a-8469-3ffb52f988bb.jpg#center)
[Link](https://tokopedia.link/Sx2AHlwparb) | I bought it for Rp. 295.000 at April 2020, but now it is Rp. 198.000

Haylou makes good cheap TWS for people without headphone jacks (which is starting to be more common). It lasted pretty long, but mine has a leaking battery (draining battery even when not used). Sadly I've moved on to the Edifier Neobuds Pro.

### Edifier Neobuds Pro
![Neobuds Pro](https://imgaz1.staticbg.com/thumb/view/oaupload/banggood/images/C1/DE/c86b1e9d-380d-4209-ad9b-153446403029.png#center)
[Link](https://tokopedia.link/rhpqLrWparb) | Rp. 1.575.000

I just got these a few days ago, and they blew my mind away. The dynamic equalizer is amazing, and it also provides 4 bands of parametric EQ (custom frequency and Q value setting), if you want to apply a low/high shelf filter yourself. The noise cancelling is so good that I can't hear cars and motorcycles when I'm taking an evening walk. It has LDAC, LHDC (but personally I don't really hear a difference). The touch controls are great, and the sensitivity can be tweaked. I don't see myself spending any more than this for a better TWS. The few nitpicks I have are that I don't see the point of having a low noise cancelling mode, if you can just disable the ANC instead. Also, no hold controls, only double and triple tap.

## Headphones
### Rexus DAXA TS1
![TS1](https://rexus.id/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/DaxaHeadset_01-1-600x600.jpg#center)
[Link](https://tokopedia.link/I7IeWCsqarb) | Rp. 749.000

A cheap version of the Steelseries Arctis 1 wireless, for half the price, made by an Indonesian brand. The wireless connection uses USB instead of bluetooth, so the sound quality of the music won't turn to crap when you are opening discord (bluetooth turns to mono if you are using the mic and the audio at the same time). The connection is so strong that I can go to the toilet while wearing it without breaking the connection. It has a mute mic toggle button, which is nice, especially combined with the wireless aspect of this headset. My complaint is that the headset can fall out of my head if I move my head too fast. I bought these at December 2021, so it has outlived my Razer Kraken X. Next target is to outlive my Corsair HS35, which was 1 year old before the hinge broke.

## Keyboard
### Press play Rover84
![ROVER84](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/500-square/VqbcmM/2022/2/16/9ba02a14-583c-4afe-8dee-efaccc253087.jpg#center)
[Link](https://tokopedia.link/rxbTJD0qarb) | Rp. 1.199.000 but sometimes goes on discount to Rp. 989.000

Basically a Rexus Daxa M84, which itself is a Royal Kludge RK84. The difference is that these come with custom PBT dye-sublimated keycaps. My first true hot swappable keyboard, I lubed it and added foam myself. Although to be honest, I think I would prefer the Vortexseries GT-8 with the bigger keyboard, audio based RBG, and a knob (it is fun to spin this, after all I was a Sound Voltex player). I bought these at August 2021, so the GT-8 wasn't out yet at that time, and the Noir N2 Pro was out of stock, sad.

## Mouse
### Logitech G304
![G304](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1WQR2EgaTBuNjSszfq6xgfpXaj/2018-Terbaru-Logitech-G304-LIGHTSPEED-Gaming-Mouse-dengan-Sensor-HERO-12000Dpi-400ips-Baterai-AA-Wireless-Mouse.jpg_Q90.jpg_.webp#center)
[Link](https://tokopedia.link/QxYGRSMefrb) | Rp. 485.000

A wireless mouse that uses a single AA battery. I bought this on August 2019 and it still serves me well. Essentially a wireless version of the G102. You can make this mouse lighter by using an AAA to AA battery adapter, and/or 3D print a honeycomb case for your palm. I can attest for the longevity of this mouse, because 3 years and I have yet to encounter issues. If you prefer 
a wireless mouse that can be recharged, get a rechargeable battery and it will last way longer than any other rechargable mice. You also don't have to worry about the internal battery dying.

### Razer Viper Mini
![RVM](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/500-square/VqbcmM/2021/8/18/d51ad51c-a1c2-4b5e-84bc-3102291ef3bd.jpg#center)
[Link](https://tokopedia.link/IIe6b3kffrb) | Rp. 400.000

The only thing I can attest is that the shape is more comfortable than my G304, and the cable is nice. I hate Razer Synapse, but that software is optional if you don't want to configure the mouse.

## Dishonorable mentions
These are what I had bought, but **will definitely not repurchase**.
