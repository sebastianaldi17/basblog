***DISCLAIMERS:***
- These are affiliate links, so if you do buy from these (for some reason), thank you.
- **I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THESE ITEMS** (except the food ones, which I ate them before). Which is why they are in my shopping list.

# Audio gear in general
<!--FR COMPARE TOOLS HERE https://forum.hifiguides.com/t/iem-graph-comparison-tool/22730-->
There is fun in enjoying new products, even though you might already have a different product that does the thing you needed. For example, there are going to be many IEMs below, even though you can use EQ(equalizer) to have different sound signatures.

All entries on the product name column can be pressed.
|Product Name|Type|Price|Notes|
|-|-|-|-|
|[NYK Nemesis MCN-05](https://tokopedia.link/NH2PqaRefrb)|USB microphone|Rp. 379.000|A USB microphone that one of my seniorsused. Seems like it comes with a desk clip for the mic.
|[Thronmax Pulse M8](https://tokopedia.link/VCqB13Zffrb)|USB microphone|Rp. 449.000| A USB microphone that Mr. DankPods featured on his cheap USB microphone roundup.
|[Fantech Leviosa MCX01](https://tokopedia.link/WVcHhI7wUpb)|USB microphone|Rp. 539.000|A USB microphone from an Indonesian gaming brand.
|[Dayton IMM-6](https://tokopedia.link/PYAGNYFxxxb)|Calibrated microphone|Rp. 599.000|A microphone that serves as an RTA analyzer. I would like to use it for measuring the frequence response of IEMs I own.
|[Moondrop Quarks DSP](https://tokopedia.link/IaLaVLb9dwb)|1DD IEM|Rp. 239.000|Quarks but uses USB-C with Digital Signal Processing (DSP). Stay tuned for Moondrop JIU though, the successor of Chu but with DSP.
|[Tangzeu Wan'Er](https://tokopedia.link/F7xR6xf9dwb)|1DD IEM|Rp. 249.000|Another budget chi-fi flavor of the month, 2022 was wack.
|[Tin HiFi C2](https://tokopedia.link/oH0iszd9dwb)|1DD IEM|Rp. 459.000|A budget offering from Tin HiFi, a hit or miss. Super* Reviews like them, Timmy from GizAudio doesn't.
|[Blon BL-03](https://tokopedia.link/LCd2zh8Assb)|1DD IEM|Rp. 299.000|Probably the cheapest (but still agreed to be good) bassy IEM. Tripowin Mele is more expensive and the bass is a bit too much.
|[Kiwi Ears Cadenza](https://tokopedia.link/HLHTnOk9dwb)|1DD IEM|Rp. 560.000|I'll be honest, the reason I want these is because of the looks. It looks so cool. Sound profile is (supposedly) very good too.
|[Truthears Hexa](https://tokopedia.link/2MEXMCGbgwb)|1DD 3BA IEM|Rp. 1.950.000*|Referred to some as "budget Blessing2" (Blessing2 itself costs 4.5mil). If you are interested in buying one though, it is cheaper to buy it from AliExpress (like 500k cheaper)
|[Sennheiser IE200](https://tokopedia.link/YUL5BUDxxxb)|1DD IEM|Rp. 2.600.000|A cheaper IE600, which should be amazing in theory.


# Keyboard & accessories
Mechanical keyboards, keycaps, switches, case, lube, foam go here.
![NK Cream](https://cf.shopee.co.id/file/026ef92e715792d6f7b333fe81fdd351#center)
- [Kailh x NovelKeys Cream](https://tokopedia.link/3UVSLmjAssb) Supposedly the best sounding linear switches. Very expensive, for almost $1 per switch.
![N2 Pro](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/700/VqbcmM/2022/2/18/2ec97c84-b424-4d20-aec4-99845d6033e7.jpg#center)
- [Noir Gear N2 Pro](https://tokopedia.link/WFywz8z0krb) A good pre-built TKL mechanical keyboard. A rare commodity since most of them kept doing boards without f1-f12, or with cramped arrow keys (which sucks as a coder).

# Tech
Tech-related stuff (monitor, PC parts, cables, mice, smart wearables, VR headsets, and others) go here
![M800](https://www.deluxworld.com/uploads/admin/image/20210617/pro-det02.png#center)
- [Delux M800](https://tokopedia.link/25QgOvDAssb) A Razer Viper Ultimate ripoff for way cheaper.
![IMM6](https://www.daytonaudio.com/images/product/large/1117_3_.jpg#center)
- [Dayton IMM6](https://tokopedia.link/WvG2i6JAssb) A spectrum analyzer for analyzing frequency response. Seems pretty interesting to measure an IEM by yourself.
![Daxa Air IV](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/500-square/VqbcmM/2022/4/27/3d2e5f02-7540-4774-8117-80f4a47c9f42.jpg#center)
- [Rexus Daxa Air IV](https://tokopedia.link/q8YJhghyUpb) Indonesian brand mouse that has a holed pattern cover if that is what you enjoy. Comes in many colors.
![mini](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/900/VqbcmM/2022/1/16/a838b0fe-a931-498e-8cd3-77a6af25275c.jpg)
- [SDVX mini controller](https://tokopedia.link/Bn8lnP9Assb) I used to play Sound Voltex a lot, but I rarely play it now because the nearest arcade that has Sound Voltex is like 16.5km away. This is a mini controller, that can be used with either Sound Voltex cloud or K-Shoot Mania
![big](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/900/VqbcmM/2021/5/23/389a65a4-54db-4b0c-9c75-5981b97c19b7.jpg#center)
- [SDVX entry level controller](https://tokopedia.link/AO8pvxjBssb) Another Sound Voltex controller that is bigger. The size is accurate to the ones at the arcade.
![Quest2](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/300/product-1/2020/9/17/2016579/2016579_a1ae4d30-8fda-4ebd-b278-75aaffd7cb06_2000_2000#center)
- [Oculus Quest 2](https://tokopedia.link/J77v2DwyUpb) As I said in my first post, I like rhythm games. To experience beat saber, I need to get a VR kit that uses a computer or get a standalone VR console like the Oculus Quest 2. Other alternatives should be welcome if I can find them.
- I'm planning on getting a PC later, maybe using an RTX 4060 a few months after the release date, and also wait for DDR5 to be mainstream, as well as Ryzen 5000 series.

# Food
![Oven cooked white potato chips](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/300/product-1/2020/6/16/98869546/98869546_8eca1dfe-9bf2-48f9-a197-5484a66ae017_1000_1000#center)
- White potato chips are a guilty pleasure of mine.
![cookies](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/300/VqbcmM/2021/10/6/446d01d9-09c1-4cee-9cf9-4ec54a8ab2e9.jpg#center)
- [Endorphins cookies](https://tokopedia.link/sJvj4XP3Wob), my supervisor once got these for me and I loved the taste.

# Miscellaneous
Other stuff that is not related to tech (office chair, weighted blanket, pillows) go here
- I wanted a nice office chair that won't break the bank (Herman Millers are crazy expensive). The only thing I know I want is probably a headrest. Purchasing chairs online is a hit or miss, so I think I prefer checking out my local Informa or IKEA to try their chairs.
- [Weighted blankets](https://tokopedia.link/0uIu7uZeXob). They claim to help people sleep, and I think it would be nice to have. I tried sleep sprays but didn't notice much of a difference in my quality of sleep tbh.
- [Genki book](https://tokopedia.link/R90uKtczUpb) - I have no idea why a lot of people recommended this book for beginners. Maybe it's like a book for elementary kids to learn English, but this one is Japanese?
- [Japanese Kanji Made Easy](https://tokopedia.link/T0pHy6IyUpb) - A book of 1000 kanji for N5 up to N2. There might be cheaper ones out there, because the one I found on Amazon was $14. Then again, customs are a thing...
