# Glossary
In this section I will explain all acronyms/terms, so that readers (including myself) will not get confused.
## Audio related glossary
- IEM: In Ear Monitors. There are three types of "earphones", which are:
    - Earphones: These are the normal circular ones of old. An example of an earphone would be the Sennheiser MX500.
    ![MX500](https://s1.bukalapak.com/img/61425691/large/Sennheiser_MX500_headphones1.jpg#center)
    - In Ear Monitors (IEM): They insert all the way to the ear canals, creating a seal. Some also refer to these as earbuds, but others say that earbuds are different from IEMs. For me, as long as an earphone has an eartip that goes into your ear canal, it is an IEM. For examples of IEMs, just google "Knowledge Zenith" and it will show up. Other brands include Moondrop, Tanchjim, Tripowin, and many more.
    ![KZ ZST](https://www.knowledge-zenith.id/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/KZ-ZST-PRo-300x300.jpg#center)
- TWS: True Wireless Stereo: These are earphones/earbuds/IEMs that don't use any cable at all (except for charging). Some wireless sport earbuds still use a cable to connect the two earbuds, but TWS has none. An example of a TWS would be the Sony WF-1000XM4.
![WF-1000XM4](https://www.sony.co.id/image/94088f8619f707627aef76cc3235b99d?fmt=png-alpha&wid=720#center)
- ANC: Active Noise Cancelling. Passive noise cancelling is when your ear canals are sealed. Active noise cancelling uses microphones on the earbuds to listen to low frequencies and neutralize it, lowering the ambient volume outside. An example of audio gear with active noise cancelling would be the Sone WF-1000XM4, mentioned above.
- DAC: Digital to Analog Converter. These convert digital signal to analog signal, that can be played by your speaker/headphone/earphone/etc. These come with your laptop/PC/smartphones, but there are external DACs of higher quality, or maybe more features. An example of a DAC would be the AudioQuest DragonFly Red.
![DragonFly Red](https://d1aeri3ty3izns.cloudfront.net/media/75/756559/600/preview.jpg#center)
- Neutral (audio): Frequencies can be divided into bass, midrange, and treble. Headphones/IEMs/etc can be tuned to make the bass louder, or make the treble softer. A neutral tuning is where none of the frequencies are boosted. A detailed breakdown can be seen below:
![FR](https://crinacle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fr-chart.png#center)
- V-shaped (audio): A tuning where the bass and treble are boosted, and the midrange is lowered. Called V because frequency order is bass-midrange-treble, and by having a low midrange with high bass and treble, the line looks somewhat like a V.
- Warm (audio): A tuning where the bass is boosted, and tends to be a downward slope from bass to midrange to treble.
- Cold (audio): A tuning where the treble is boosted, and tends to be an upward slope from bass to midrange to treble.
- Shouty (audio): A boost in the upper midrange frequency, as if the IEM/headphones are shouting into your ear.

## Keyboard related glossary
- Switches: The mechanisms under the keycaps, for registering the keystrokes. Mechanical keyboard switches are divided into three types:
    - Linear: Responds faster, but has no feedback if a key is registered.
    ![Red](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2016/09/Red.gif#center)
    - Tactile: Has a noticeable bump when a key is pressed.
    ![Brown](http://mech-keyboards.weebly.com/uploads/4/9/7/4/49743797/7458259_orig.gif#center)
    - Clicky: When a key is registered into the computer, there will be a loud CLICK. This will drive anyone in the same room as you crazy.
    ![Blue](https://www.keyboardco.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Blue.gif#center)
- Hot-swappable: A feature where keyboard switches can be removed without desoldering them. There are two types of hot-swappable, 3 pin and 5 pin. Hot-swappable keyboards that support 5 pin will support 3 pin, but not vice versa. If you have a hot-swappable keyboard that only supports 3 pin, you can clip the plastic legs on the 5 pin switch.
![Pins](https://fantechworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3pin-Vs-5pin-pngc-1024x573.png)
- PCB: Printed Circuit Board. This is not specific to keyboards only.
![PCB](https://www.pcbonline.com/file/2021-05-13/keyboard-pcb.jpg)
- South-facing: PCBs that have the lighting on the south. This way, cherry keycap profiles won't cause interference. Interference is when the keycaps hit the top of the switch, preventing proper bottom-out.
![south vs north](https://keyboardable.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/north_vs_south_switches.jpg#center)
## Tech related glossary
- PC: Personal Computer. The large rectangle towers that does not come with anything.
- VR: Virtual Reality. A simulated world that you can experience with a special headset.

# Audio gear in general
<!--FR COMPARE TOOLS HERE https://forum.hifiguides.com/t/iem-graph-comparison-tool/22730-->
<!--TODO add blon bl03, moondrop aria, dunu titan s, tinhifi t3 plus-->
|Product Name|Type|Price|Notes|
|-|-|-|-|
|[Eartips](https://www.tokopedia.com/audionstore)|Eartips|Rp. 75.000-200.000|Do these really impact sound?
|[CCA CRA](https://tokopedia.link/IMSvSyfwUpb)|IEM|Rp. 209.000|A V-shaped IEM (bass and treble boosted)
|[Tripowin Lea](https://tokopedia.link/nS4PLtzwUpb)|IEM|Rp. 399.000|A neutral IEM
|[KZ ZEX Pro / CRN](https://tokopedia.link/Ab4livMwUpb)|IEM|Rp.299.000|A triple driver neutral IEM, but most of the sound comes from the dynamic driver. Read more [here](https://crinacle.com/2022/03/07/the-crn-kz-situation/). Also, there is a volume spike on 8k Hz.
|[Fantech Leviosa MCX01](https://tokopedia.link/WVcHhI7wUpb)|USB microphone|Rp. 539.000|A USB microphone from an Indonesian gaming brand. Other alternatives that are similar in price include the Thronmax Pulse M8, Soundtech USB microphone, Costa CM-U100. Or maybe just use a condenser mic with phantom power (this uses another power outlet though).
|[Moondrop Nekocake](https://tokopedia.link/0TEvquaAUpb)|TWS|Rp. 639.000|A TWS with active noise cancelling(ANC). Supposedly has very good audio, but bad ANC and battery life. Also, no transparency/passthrough mode.
|[Hidizs H2](https://tokopedia.link/Mcvul8rxUpb)|DAC|Rp. 799.000| Accepts a 3.5mm earphone/headphone to make it have a bluetooth connection. Supports aptX and LDAC. If you want to spend more money, you can also go for a [Fiio BTR5](https://tokopedia.link/s26BKpPxUpb), or a [Qudelix 5k](https://tokopedia.link/nZNKjKSxUpb).
|[1More ComfoBuds Pro](https://tokopedia.link/VqQ2uEOzUpb)|TWS|Rp. 1.099.000|A relatively good TWS with ANC under $100. The cheapest ANC TWS I had (before I gave it to my father) was the [Realme Buds Air 2 Neo](https://tokopedia.link/17UAWgXzUpb). It was decent.

# Keyboard & accessories
Mechanical keyboards, keycaps, switches, case, lube, foam go here.
- My go-to shop for mechanical keyboards and peripherals is [this shop](https://www.tokopedia.com/mechkeyboardsid/product), I like linear switches so I might research them more later.
![GT-8](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/300/VqbcmM/2022/3/27/ec340a4d-147a-4d66-aba8-3bfe0424e9c4.jpg#center)
- [Vortexseries GT-8](https://tokopedia.link/7KAmjQ0xUpb) Hot-swappable, south-facing PCB, wireless, has a knob, includes foam. Such a shame it does not have a print screen key. For extra money, you can get one that comes with JWK ultimate blacks. For less money, you can get a barebones version, but it is only a price difference of Rp. 60.000, compared to the ones with keycaps and outemu switches.

# Tech
Tech-related stuff (monitor, PC parts, cables, mice, smart wearables, VR headsets, and others) go here
![Paracontrol XL v2](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/300/VqbcmM/2021/12/30/8884a30f-2593-4bf5-8680-f3f5a13f30a6.jpg#center)
- [Pulsar Paracontrol XL V2](https://tokopedia.link/7Erxw9byUpb) Rp. 389.000 46cm x 41cm mousepad, I prefer control mousepads because the games I play tend to have low time to kill.
- [Rexus Daxa Air IV](https://tokopedia.link/q8YJhghyUpb) Rp. 759.000 & weighs 64 grams - Indonesian brand mouse that has a holed pattern cover if that is what you enjoy. Comes in many colors.
- A 144Hz monitor, or an ultrawide monitor. An ultrawide 144Hz monitor is extremely expensive though.
![Quest2](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/300/product-1/2020/9/17/2016579/2016579_a1ae4d30-8fda-4ebd-b278-75aaffd7cb06_2000_2000#center)
- [Oculus Quest 2](https://tokopedia.link/J77v2DwyUpb) Rp. 5.045.000 - As I said in my first post, I like rhythm games. To experience beat saber, I need to get a VR kit that uses a computer or get a standalone VR console like the Oculus Quest 2. Other alternatives should be welcome if I can find them.
- I'm planning on getting a PC later once the price of graphics cards settles down, or when AMD's RDNA 2 integrated graphics chipset arrives (probably late 2022, but no rumors as of writing)

# Food
![Oven cooked white potato chips](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/300/product-1/2020/6/16/98869546/98869546_8eca1dfe-9bf2-48f9-a197-5484a66ae017_1000_1000#center)
- White potato chips are a guilty pleasure of mine. Costs Rp. 20.000 / 100 grams.
![cookies](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/300/VqbcmM/2021/10/6/446d01d9-09c1-4cee-9cf9-4ec54a8ab2e9.jpg#center)
- [Endorphins cookies](https://tokopedia.link/sJvj4XP3Wob), my superior once got these for me and I loved the taste.

# Miscellaneous
Other stuff that is not related to tech (office chair, weighted blanket, pillows) go here
- I wanted a nice office chair that won't break the bank (Herman Millers are crazy expensive). The only thing I know I want is probably a headrest. Purchasing chairs online is a hit or miss, so I think I prefer checking out my local Informa or IKEA to try their chairs.
- [Weighted blankets](https://tokopedia.link/0uIu7uZeXob). They claim to help people sleep, and I think it would be nice to have. I tried sleep sprays but didn't notice much of a difference in my quality of sleep tbh.
- [Genki book](https://tokopedia.link/R90uKtczUpb) - I have no idea why a lot of people recommended this book for beginners. Maybe it's like a book for elementary kids to learn English, but this one is Japanese?
- [Japanese Kanji Made Easy](https://tokopedia.link/T0pHy6IyUpb) - A book of 1000 kanji for N5 up to N2. There might be cheaper ones out there, because the one I found on Amazon was $14. Then again, customs are a thing...
