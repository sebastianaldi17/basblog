# Audio gear in general
Speakers, Headphones, IEM, TWS, microphones, DAC/Amps go here 
## Under Rp. 1.000.000 ($70)
- Eartips from [here](https://www.tokopedia.com/audionstore) that costs between Rp. 75.000 - Rp. 200.000 / set... Eartips for IEMs have their rabbit hole :tired_face:
![KZ ZEX Pro](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/300/VqbcmM/2022/1/14/c649bdc0-6b2f-450e-b92f-8365b3b57f96.jpg#center)
- [KZ ZEX Pro](https://tokopedia.link/oJUd1SqXWob) Rp. 299.000 - Tuned by an audiophile that ranks a lot of IEMs. Like, a [lot](https://crinacle.com/rankings/iems/). There is some controversy regarding this IEM because it has three drivers (Magnetostatic + Balanced Armature + Dynamic Drivers), but due to bad engineering, only the dynamic driver is the one that outputs most of the sound. Read more [here](https://crinacle.com/2022/03/07/the-crn-kz-situation/).
![Tanchjim Tanya](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/300/VqbcmM/2021/5/2/91521109-83e5-48c7-a4d9-5bc78c611fd2.jpg#center)
- [Tanchjim Tanya](https://tokopedia.link/IrY6ERbXWob) Rp. 320.000 - Uses a dynamic driver. Non-removable cables, which could be a dealbreaker for some.
![Tripowin Lea](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/300/VqbcmM/2022/1/6/82bd2d8a-4d26-4cf0-9ca4-4a3e2ed91bc2.jpg#center)
- [Tripowin Lea](https://tokopedia.link/Ccy8P1OWWob) Rp. 400.000 - Uses a Liquid Crystal Polymer Dynamic Driver, how fancy. Not much bass, with an emphasis on treble. 
![Leviosa](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/300/VqbcmM/2021/2/8/33794094-7aa3-4857-b4e9-1c739f18c030.jpg#center)
- [Fantech Leviosa](https://tokopedia.link/Siun965dXob) Rp.499.000 - USB microphone that sits at your desk. The common consensus is that rather than getting a gaming headset, people are better off getting a good headphone/IEM and getting a separate microphone. I'm still exploring my options.
## Over Rp. 1.000.000
![BTR5](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/300/VqbcmM/2021/10/24/02367f4e-af86-4361-a4a4-0878597bbaf7.jpg#center)
- [Fiio BTR5](https://tokopedia.link/MIvWxRRcXob) Rp. 1.950.000 - By connecting any earphones/headphones to this device, it becomes wireless. There are cheaper alternatives to this, such as the Hidisz H2.
![XM4](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/300/VqbcmM/2022/3/4/a30e02d7-556b-42ac-9b85-9e0fc6303fc7.jpg#center)
- [Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless noise-canceling Headphones](https://tokopedia.link/0p77wzPXWob) Rp. 3.749.000

The mainstream king of active noise-canceling wireless headphones... I wonder if it is worth the price or not. Maybe the XM3 is also worth considering.
![XM4TWS](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/300/VqbcmM/2022/3/9/abbe2d38-1163-46a5-9097-9057cc367d8a.jpg#center)
- [Sony WF-1000XM4 True Wireless noise-canceling Headphones](https://tokopedia.link/ZI24yX3XWob) Rp. 3.499.000

Mainstream TWS king, basically the WH-1000XM4 in TWS form. Again, they also have the XM3 for way cheaper, so maybe that is worth being considered.

# Keyboard & accessories
Mechanical keyboards, keycaps, switches, case, lube, foam go here
## Under Rp. 1.000.000 ($70)
- My go-to shop for mechanical keyboards and peripherals is [this shop](https://www.tokopedia.com/mechkeyboardsid/product), I like linear switches so I might research them more later.
![GT-8](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/300/VqbcmM/2022/3/27/ec340a4d-147a-4d66-aba8-3bfe0424e9c4.jpg#center)
- [Vortexseries GT-8](https://tokopedia.link/qpnMxFuYWob) Rp. 780.000 - Hot-swappable, south-facing PCB, wireless, has a knob, includes foam. Such a shame it does not have a print screen key.
## Over Rp. 1.000.000
Honestly? I haven't thought about getting an expensive keyboard. There are keyboards out there that are expensive, but I don't think it's worth the price, especially if you see the cost of DROP keyboards or the Keychron Q series.

# Tech
Tech-related stuff (monitor, pc parts, cables, mice, smart wearables, VR headsets, and others) go here
## Under Rp. 1.000.000 ($70)
![Paracontrol XL v2](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/300/VqbcmM/2021/12/30/8884a30f-2593-4bf5-8680-f3f5a13f30a6.jpg#center)
- [Pulsar Paracontrol XL V2](https://tokopedia.link/mqqu5bDcXob) Rp. 389.000 46cm x 41cm mousepad, I prefer control mousepads because the games I play tend to have low time to kill.
![Delux M800](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/300/VqbcmM/2021/6/23/80ff7b8b-dd8d-4e49-9f31-1f622a3d51f2.jpg#center)
- [Delux M800](https://tokopedia.link/Or3LdyV1Wob) Rp. 369.000 & weighs 70 grams - A wireless Razer Viper Mini ripoff which is pretty good, but do note that there are two versions of this mouse with different sensors:
    - The one I linked uses a Pixart PAW3335, which is better but has a lift-off distance (LOD) issue which could be fixed using software
    - The other one uses a PAW3325, which has no LOD issue but is worse than the PAW3335 version
![Icarus](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/300/VqbcmM/2021/10/24/38213293-0d8f-45d7-af12-8b6b2f5b8d40.jpg#center)
- [Press Play Icarus](https://tokopedia.link/QI29SEo2Wob) Rp. 489.000 & weighs 77 grams - A mouse from an Indonesian brand that looks good on paper, can't comment much because I don't have it. Uses a Pixart PAW3338 sensor.
![XD5](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/300/VqbcmM/2021/10/16/1cbd238e-59da-4f88-958f-c865c177e37c.jpg#center)
- [Fantech Helios XD5](https://tokopedia.link/0Zae29F2Wob) Rp. 659.000 & weighs 72 grams - Another Indonesian brand mouse, but this one is shaped for ergonomics & uses a Pixart PAW3370.
![Daxa Air II](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/300/VqbcmM/2022/3/5/ca890a64-395f-4bb2-87a6-f27405e54f08.jpg#center)
- [Rexus Daxa Air II](https://tokopedia.link/RPcPIr6mYob) Rp. 659.000 & weighs 77 grams - Another Indonesian brand mouse that has a honeycomb cover if that is what you enjoy. Comes in many colors. 

## Over Rp. 1.000.000
![LG 24GN600-B](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/300/VqbcmM/2021/7/16/3fda50c1-dd77-43b0-ab25-fc8a11e9da61.jpg#center)
- [LG 24GN600-B 144hz IPS](https://tokopedia.link/5g82NT82Wob) Rp. 2.799.000 - It doesn't have to be this monitor, I'm just looking for a monitor that has an IPS panel and is 144hz.
![G Pro X Superlight](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/300/VqbcmM/2022/2/22/559e3e80-78a4-468c-a5c2-795d9fa17e10.jpg#center)
- [Logitech G Pro X Superlight](https://tokopedia.link/MuBfEPm3Wob) Rp. 1.889.000 & weighs under 63 grams - Probably the most cliche mouse that everyone wants, including me...
![Quest2](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/300/product-1/2020/9/17/2016579/2016579_a1ae4d30-8fda-4ebd-b278-75aaffd7cb06_2000_2000#center)
- [Oculus Quest 2](https://tokopedia.link/URNpeUJdXob) Rp. 5.045.000 - As I said in my first post, I like rhythm games. To experience beat saber, I need to get a VR kit that uses a computer or get a standalone VR console like the Oculus Quest 2. Other alternatives should be welcome if I can find them.
- I'm planning on getting a PC later once the price of graphics cards settles down, or when AMD's RDNA 2 integrated graphics chipset arrives (probably late 2022, but no rumors as of writing)

# Food
![Oven cooked white potato chips](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/300/product-1/2020/6/16/98869546/98869546_8eca1dfe-9bf2-48f9-a197-5484a66ae017_1000_1000#center)
- White potato chips are a guilty pleasure of mine. Costs Rp. 20.000 / 100 grams.
![cookies](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/300/VqbcmM/2021/10/6/446d01d9-09c1-4cee-9cf9-4ec54a8ab2e9.jpg#center)
- [Endorphins cookies](https://tokopedia.link/sJvj4XP3Wob), my superior once got these for me and I loved the taste.

# Miscellaneous
Other stuff that is not related to tech (office chair, weighted blanket, pillows) go here
- I wanted a nice office chair that won't break the bank (Herman Millers are crazy expensive). The only thing I know I want is probably a headrest. These three maybe are what I'm looking for, but purchasing chairs online is a hit or miss. I might need to check out my local Informa or IKEA to try their chairs.

  - https://tokopedia.link/SfFOoHUeXob
- [Weighted blankets](https://tokopedia.link/0uIu7uZeXob). They claim to help people sleep, and I think it would be nice to have.
