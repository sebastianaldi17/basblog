# Introduction
My name is Sebastian Aldi. I am a computer science graduate from Universitas Pelita Harapan, currently working at Tokopedia as a Backend Engineer. My main programming languages are `python`, `javascript` and `go`, but I usually just go with the flow and learn more if required. My main interests are backend and frontend development, as well as game development.

# Hobbies
I have three hobbies, which are audio gear, mechanical keyboards, and rhythm games.
## Rhythm Games
I think ever since I was little, I liked rhythm games. My first rhythm game is probably [VOS](http://downloadgamejadul.blogspot.com/2017/05/download-game-jadul-vos-virtual.html) (Virtual Orchestra Studio), which was a vertical scrolling rhythm game with seven keys. Funnily enough, I can't seem to play seven keys anymore. Maybe back then the songs were too easy.

I also played [Tap a Jam](https://tap-a-jam.software.informer.com/download/), which was a horizontal scrolling rhythm game with four keys. Horizontal scrolling is weird, maybe that is why I can't get used to Muse Dash (other than needing to play more)

When I was on high school I started playing osu!mania four keys only, and it was fun. I even reached top 15.000 global just by playing four keys instead of the more mainstream seven keys. You can see my osu!mania profile [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6214981/mania). I kind of peaked at S-ranking 4.5-5 stars but my stamina capped hard :laughing:

On my time at university I started playing rhythm games at my local arcade. The games I played are Sound Voltex, maimai, and Pump It Up (5 arrows) / Dance Dance Revolution (4 arrows). Out of the four games I mentioned, only maimai and Pump It Up are the ones that is still available at my local arcade, but playing Pump It Up using a mask during this pandemic times is a challenge. I can still play Sound Voltex if I went to a different arcade that is further than my usual spot, but it uses a different card system compared to my local arcade so I need to keep multiple arcade cards. Honestly though, since my eyes hurt if I don't blink for too long, I stopped grinding scores seriously and just play for fun / enjoy new songs.

## Audio(phile)
As someone who likes rhythm games, I really like the music made for them. Sometimes the artists would release a longer version of their music, which makes it perfect for a listening session (arcade music are usually 1.5 - 2.5 minutes long, so that the ones queueing to play won't have to wait for too long). I have a few headphone/IEM/TWS laying around that still works, which are:
- Haylou GT1 Pro (TWS)
An okay TWS that I got for Rp. 295.000 on April 2020. No longer used but should still work.

- Realme Buds 2 Air Neo (TWS)
A TWS with active noise cancelling & transparency mode that I got for Rp. 469.000 on January 2022. Currently my daily driver if I need to go outside.

- Moondrop Spaceship (IEM)
An IEM that I got for Rp. 271.500 on March 2022. It is good, but sadly the cable is not removable. Also, the legend (left / right marking) is very hard to read.
![spaceship](https://cf.shopee.co.id/file/cc0b051d9271f9467c1e08af139ef481#center)
- KZ ZS3 (IEM)
My first IEM that I got a long time ago, so long that my Tokopedia account has no records of me buying this (because I changed accounts once or twice). Quality is good, lasted me for 3 years and is still going strong. Cable is removable (and can be upgraded to a bluetooth cable if that is what you want), sound quality is decent for their price.
![ZS3](https://cf.shopee.co.id/file/041a9570477443a45d4e7b289344a938_tn#center)
- Venture Electronics Monk Plus (Earsets)
Earphones with mic that I bought for Rp. 157.000 on June 2020. I never used these because I like IEMs more than earphones. The only reason I bought these are because that they supposedly sound very good for their price. I wouldn't agree or disagree on that.

## Mechanical Keyboards
On the subject of games, a lot of gamers (not just rhythm gamers) do like to use mechanical keyboards. I use a ROVER84, which is a Royal Kludge 84 with custom PBT keycaps, sold by an Indonesian brand. I prefer linear switches, so I chose the ones that came with Gateron yellow switches.
![ROVER84](https://images.tokopedia.net/img/cache/500-square/VqbcmM/2022/2/16/9ba02a14-583c-4afe-8dee-efaccc253087.jpg#center)
I don't have much experience with disassembling or desoldering mechanical keyboards, the most tinkering I did was lubing the switches on my keyboard. Mostly I am just afraid of breaking my keyboard, but I will try to gather some courage to take apart my keyboard :smile:

# Skillset
I consider myself a jack of all trades, master of none. I have experience with a lot of stuff, yet I don't feel confident enough to say I mastered something. In this section I will spill out all of my small experiences.

## Python (programming language)
This is probably my best friend since university. Introduced to me for data science in university, this language is very handy. I participated in competitive programming, and while python is relatively slower than C++ or Java, the amount of code that you need to write to solve a problem is shorter. It is very nice to use python for tackling easy problem solving questions that don't require program speed. Also, it is very easy to convert data types. For example,
```python
s = input() # all inputs in python 3 are considered strings
s = int(s) # change to int
s += 11 # increment s by 11
s = str(s) # converts back to string
``` 
converting data types only require a call to `type()` (can be int, str, float). There are also other "handy" features, such as having multiple types of variables on one list (`l = [1, 2.0, "3"] # is a valid list`)
Here are some tips for python competitive programmers:
```python
# takes a space separated integers and converts it into a python list
arr = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
# takes 2 space separated integers and assign it to variables a and b
a, b = map(int, input().split())
```

## Javscript (programming language)
I would include node.js (made a discord bot that scrapes r/dankmemes and send it to a certain channel every hour) and react (made a personal website using material-ui) as part of javascript. I would also include AJAX, jQuery, Angular, Vue, and Typescript as part of javascript, but **as of writing this I have little to no experience using them.**. I'm just so used to react that it feels kinda wrong when I try to make a website using other tech. I do have interest on learning laravel/codeigniter though, and I did make a website using php for my university lecture.

## Go (programming language)
Go is my main programming language at work. After all, if your workplace requires you to use a certain language because it is their stack, then you should be good at it. I say that, but I only have one year of experience using Go professionally (I also only have one year of work experiencee, go figure). Fun fact, this blog was made using hugo, which uses Go :smile:

## Java (programming language)
Java was the first programming language that I used to create user interfaces. My first programming language that I was taught is C++, but it is mostly used for console input/output, nothing flashy. Using JavaFX (sadly deprecated) / Swing was mindblowing the first time I learned about it. There is also canvas where you can draw things programatically, which is even more mindblowing for me. An example program that I made using Java was [minesweeper using swing](https://github.com/sebastianaldi17/JavaSweeper).

## Photo editing (paint.net, photoshop)
I can do some image editing to some degree. I understand how layers work, and if I need to do a specific task I would usually look up a tutorial on how to. Designing something is a different task though, because it needs :sparkles: **c r e a t i v i t y** :sparkles:. I can remove background from a photo though, mostly using magic wand, lasso, and eraser tool.

## Video editing (premiere, hitfilm express)
I can also use video editing software, because I was taught how to use adobe premiere on high school. Since premiere is a paid program, nowadays I use hitfilm express. It has a very similar experience and interface to premiere, with some capabilities of adobe after effects. Also, it is free!

## Game Development
I have created some games during my university life, because I specialized in *intelligent & interactive application development* (a fancy way of saying game development). I made a game using RPG Maker MV (not very creative I know) and Godot (uses GDScript which is similar to python). I wanted to learn about Unity, but my lecturer doesn't teach me that (no reason for me to not learn by myself though). Also, I created a multiplayer game using [Godot](https://github.com/sebastianaldi17/SpaceDefender). From that endeavor, I learned that multiplayer networking is hard, my game desycned a lot and the scores differ for each person :sob: :sob: :sob:
