I have a lot of stuff that I don't use anymore, so I decided to let you guys know that if you want it you can tell me & we can arrange to meet / get it delivered.

# Terms & Conditions
- I cannot guarantee that the item will work. You will not complain about the condition of the item.
- If you want it delivered, tell me & we can discuss how we can get it delivered to you. You will need to pay the delivery cost though.

# The items
Below are the list of items & a quick reason why I'm giving it away.

## Dayton iMM-6 Calibrated Measurement Microphone
![iMM-6](/Images/FriendOnlyGiveaway/imm6.jpg)
I used to be a huge earbuds maniac, but I realized that I can't really hear the subtle differences that much. I got a calibrated mic to measure the earbuds, but they need a tube to prevent outside noise from interfering with it. I ended up not using it at all.

## Keycaps
![keycaps](/Images/FriendOnlyGiveaway/keycaps.jpg)
I used the keycaps, but there are some spare & some left over. Storing it takes a lot of space on the storage box & I won't change the keycaps anyway.

## PS3 Eye Camera
![eyecam](/Images/FriendOnlyGiveaway/ps3eyecam.jpg)
Bought this for recording hand cameras during VSRG gameplay (e.g. osu!mania), but I moved on. Requires a propietary driver, kind of a pain to setup. Can record up to 120fps, but I'm not interested in content creation.

## Lavalier Mic + Splitter
![mic](/Images/FriendOnlyGiveaway/lavaliermic.jpg)
I honestly prefer using earphones with microphone on them rather than having a separate mic. Just a preference thing.

# Reserved / delivered items
Below are already reserved by someone, so they are no longer available.

## Rexus coiled cable [reserved]
![Coiled cable](/Images/FriendOnlyGiveaway/coiledcable.jpg)
This thing is a pain to deal with. My current setup is to slide the cable under my desk & connect it to the PC. Besides, my keyboard has a wireless dongle...

## Tecgear Beam Light Bar [reserved]
![lightbar](/Images/FriendOnlyGiveaway/lightbar.jpg)
I bought this in hopes of "reducing the brightness" of my monitor. AOC monitors are way too bright, even in the lowest brightness setting. It didn't help, so if any of you wants a light bar, be my guest.

## Vortexseries VX8 [reserved]
![vx8](/Images/FriendOnlyGiveaway/vx8.jpg)
A keyboard that is a keyboard of that time. Switches are not hot-swappable (requires solder to remove the switch), USB cable is not detachable, no wireless support. I have 2 other spare keyboards, so this keyboard is truly obsolete.

## KZ EDA [reserved]
![eda](/Images/FriendOnlyGiveaway/kzeda.jpg)
This "earbud" is actually 3 set of earbuds. Each color has a different sound signature. Black is bassy, transparent is balaned, green is bright. They're good, but I have too much earbuds and have decided to move on from this hobby.

## Moondrop Chu 1 [reserved]
![chu](/Images/FriendOnlyGiveaway/moondropchu1.jpg)
A good balanced earbud, but cable is not detachable (unlike the newer chu 2).

## QKZ x HBB [reserved]
![qkzxhbb](/Images/FriendOnlyGiveaway/qkzxhbb.jpg)
A good bassy earbud, but I don't really like bassy earbuds.

## Truthear Zero (Blue) [reserved]
![zeroblue](/Images/FriendOnlyGiveaway/truthearzero.jpg)
Harman target earbuds that are too big for my earlobes. The nozzle size is approximately ~6.7mm.
