I have a lot of stuff that I don't use anymore, so I decided to let you guys know that if you want it you can tell me & we can arrange to meet / get it delivered.

# Terms & Conditions
- I cannot guarantee that the item will work. You will not complain about the condition of the item.
- If you want it delivered, tell me & we can discuss how we can get it delivered to you. You will need to pay the delivery cost though.

# The items
Below are the list of items & a quick reason why I'm giving it away.

## Oral B Pro 500

I bought an electric toothbrush to clean my teeth better, but it did more harm than good. The battery life sucks, the 30 second timer is not enough to clean a quadrant, and I feel like my teeth is not as clean as brushing it manually. If any of you want it, make sure to buy a new toothbrush head.

## Fake PS4 Controller

I use an 8bitdo controller, so I don't need this anymore. Works with DS4Win.

## Edifier Neobuds Pro (one side broken)

One side is broken (won't connect, even after resetting), so feel free to get it fixed in a service center. I now use a WF-1000XM5.

## Logitech G304 (double click issue)

The famous left click issue happened to my mouse, and I can't be bothered to fix it.

## Dayton iMM-6 Calibrated Measurement Microphone

I used to be a huge earbuds maniac, but I realized that I can't really hear the subtle differences that much. I got a calibrated mic to measure the earbuds, but they need a tube to prevent outside noise from interfering with it. I ended up not using it at all.

## PS3 Eye Camera

Bought this for recording hand cameras during VSRG gameplay (e.g. osu!mania), but I moved on. Requires a propietary driver, kind of a pain to setup. Can record up to 120fps, but I'm not interested in content creation.
