# Background
I had some spare keyboard switches and keycaps lying around, so I decided to buy a barebone keyboard. Not just any keyboard, but a split one. The split keyboard that I am using is the Lily58 Pro.

# Something you should know
I only realized after receiving the barebones keyboard, that split keyboards require some special keycaps. For example, 1u - 1.75u spacebar, 1u - 1.75u enter, 1u backspakce, 1u tab, etc. Thankfully I found an online store that offers custom keycap printing service, so I just made the keycap design myself and asked them to make the keycaps for me.

# Configuring
Configuring it can be done without any driver, just head towards [VIA](https://www.caniusevia.com/) and set the layers & keys to whatever you want. These are my layer configurations:

# Adapting
Buying a split keyboard really highlighted my bad typing habits. For example, I type the letter 'Y' using my left hand, but since it is split, the 'Y' is on the right side of the split. I also noticed that I don't use my thumbs, pinky finger, and ring finger. My typing style was only using 4 fingers all along.

Since the split keyboard was at my home & I am mostly at the office on weekdays, I only did typing tests before actually bringing it to work. The typing tests that I used were these:

- [Monkeytype English 60 seconds](https://monkeytype.com/)
- [TypingTom Programming 60 seconds](https://www.typingtom.com/programming/typing-test/1m)

Below is a chart of my WPM using the Lily58 Pro, after 2 weeks of typing tests.

After the first week, I find it hard to improve, especially considering I still haven't used 10 fingers, even with a split keyboard.

I ended up using the split keyboard at work to get some more typing done using it.

# Closing thoughts
If you don't have any wrist problems, I don't see a good reason to buy a split keyboard. Otherwise, go for it.

My next post will be about a website that I have been working on, but it is taking quite a long time, so I expect to post a part 1 soon. Until then, see you!
